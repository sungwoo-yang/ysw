# Stars and Light

Stars: There are “light-emitting stars” and “dead stars” that require light in the game world.

Light Emission: Light-emitting stars fire two types of light (laser) at fixed intervals.

🟡 Yellow Light: Approaches slowly like a snake. This light cannot be parried. Avoid it.

🔴 Red Light: Instantly appears and shoots toward the player. This light must be parried with your shield.

# Light Puzzle System

Shield Creation: Hold the right mouse button to create a shield at your mouse cursor position.

Slow Movement: While holding the shield (holding right click), the player’s movement becomes slower.

Parry (Light Reflection):

If red light hits the shield within 0.5 seconds after it is created, the light is successfully reflected (parried).

Use this reflected light to activate “dead stars” or trigger various mechanisms throughout the game.
